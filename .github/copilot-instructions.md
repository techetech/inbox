# Secure Email Platform with Phishing Protection

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive secure email platform with advanced phishing protection capabilities, built with a microservices architecture.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for user interface (to be implemented)
- **Backend API**: Node.js with Express/Fastify ✅
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for caching ✅
- **Storage**: S3 for attachments (configured)
- **MTA**: Postfix or Haraka for SMTP (to be implemented)
- **Security**: ClamAV antivirus, URL reputation checking, SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification ✅
- **Queue**: Redis + Bull for background processing ✅

## Features
- User registration/login with email + password ✅
- Internal mail send/receive with external mail support ✅
- Background mail delivery with queue and retry ✅
- Phishing protection: attachment antivirus, URL reputation, SPF/DKIM/DMARC ✅
- Admin dashboard for quarantine management ✅
- Dark/cyber theme UI (to be implemented)

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety ✅
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring ✅
- Follow security best practices for email handling ✅
- Use queue-based processing for mail scanning ✅
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic ✅

## Frontend Features Completed ✅
- **Dark/Cyber Theme**: Matrix-style background, neon colors, custom fonts
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Authentication Flow**: Login and registration with form validation
- **Dashboard**: Security metrics, threat monitoring, system status
- **Navigation**: Sidebar with role-based admin access
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with cyber styling
- **State Management**: React Query for API calls, Context for auth
- **Development Setup**: Vite for fast development, TypeScript for safety

## Running the Application
1. **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev` - http://localhost:3001
2. **Backend**: `npm run dev` - http://localhost:3000 (requires DB setup)

## Demo Credentials (when backend is running)
- **Email**: admin@localhost  
- **Password**: admin123

## Next Steps
1. Set up PostgreSQL database and run schema.sql
2. Set up Redis server
3. Configure environment variables in .env
4. Install and configure ClamAV
5. Implement frontend React application
6. Integrate external security services (Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal)
7. Set up SMTP server for actual email delivery
